# DocMaker

This program allows you to create a multilingual document layout easily using all known paper formats and dimentions, it also supports custom paper dimentions.

Current document objects you can add to your documents :

  - Label
  - Lines
  - Images

This program includes these features :

  - Changing paper dimentions
  - Adding external font files
  - Adding languages for label translation
  - A resource manager (Image files for now)
  - Saving/Loading project files (*.dmprj)
  - Basic data (de)compression on saving/loading projects
  - Basic object alignment and snapping system
  
Planned changes and features :  

  - Starting the document loader library project
  - Exporting projects (documents) to be loaded by the loading library on other programs
  - A powerfull object alignment and snapping system
  - More document objects (Tables, Rectangles, Bar Codes, etc...)
  - Layering system and rendering priority options
  - Add a full render option for better preview (since document objects overlapping others can't be seen)
  - More code and execution effienciency :3
  
This program is a work in progress more changes and features will be added/tweaked/removed as I go on with this project, previously saved project may not be loaded on later versions due to compatibility issues.
